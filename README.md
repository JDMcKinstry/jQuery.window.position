# jQuery.window.position

As you may or may not already know, use of `$(window).position()` will normally through an error. This is because it has a little trouble determining the actual Browser Window position. The following, very simple plugin will add a `position` method for `$(window)` while retaining all you normal Element usage such as `$('#ele').position();`

Enjoy!
